**Duckietown is a robotics educations and outreach effort.**
The project started as a graduate class in 2016 at MIT; as of 2017, six other universities have used the materials produced,
as well as dozens of self-guided learners.

The most tangible goal of the project is to provide a low-cost
educational platform for learning autonomy, consisting of the
"Duckiebots", an autonomous robot, and the "Duckietowns", the
infrastructure in which the Duckiebots navigates.

In addition to the hardware and software, we will build a
set of learning modules that can be used at various levels
of education.
