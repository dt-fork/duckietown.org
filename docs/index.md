We are in the process of transferring the documentation
from our old platform (Google Docs) to the new platform (Markdown wiki).

So, at this point you can choose to consult:

- [the new documentation][docs-new], at the site `book.duckietown.org`.
- [the old documentation][docs-old] used for the 2016 class.

[docs-new]: http://book.duckietown.org/
[docs-old]: http://duckietown.mit.edu/
