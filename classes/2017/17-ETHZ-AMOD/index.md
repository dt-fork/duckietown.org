Welcome to the webpage for the class **Autonomous Mobility on Demand: from car to fleet**.
This class is a new offering at ETH Zurich for Fall 2017. It follows
the [extremely succesfull first edition at MIT in 2016](http://duckietown.mit.edu/).

**For ETH Students**: Please sign up with the system.

Please also [fill in this questionnaire][questionnaire]. It helps
us understanding and fine tune the class.

**For ETH / Uni postdocs***:  We are looking for postdocs to help teach the class.


## Instructors

The class is offered and sponsored by the Institute of Dynamic Systems and Control.
The instructors are:

- [Prof. Emilio Frazzoli][frazzoli]
- [Dr. Andrea Censi][censi]

*We are looking for postdocs to give extra lectures on their specialties. PLease
contact Andrea Censi if you are interested.*

### Twin institutions

This class is offered at the same time in two others institutions:

- University of Montreal, Canada - Prof. Liam Paull
- University of Chicago / Toyota Technological Institute - Prof. Matthew Walter

We will develop the autonomous fleets together, and there will be a (friendly) competition at the end.

## Class philosophy

The best engineers are the ones who have solid foundations.

In autonomous robotics, it is important to also get the feeling of
what makes a robot work. The way to do this, is not to study every component in isolation,
but rather creating a rather complex system from scratch.

You can read this paper based on the first year edition of
Duckietown. The philosophy

### Broader impact beyond ETH Zurich
