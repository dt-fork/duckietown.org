Last year, at MIT, one of the collateral uses of Duckietown
was to provide an opportunity for postdocs to develop their
teaching skills. We had about 10 postdocs preparing 1 or
maximum 2 lectures on their specialty.

This is extremely recommended for postdocs preparing for an
academic career. Teaching is like swimming: you learn by
taking the plunge.

If you are interested in this, please discuss with your
supervisor if you can dedicate time to this, and then
contact [Matt Walter](http://ttic.edu/walter).

In special cases, this is also available to senior
Ph.D. students.
