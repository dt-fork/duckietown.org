This page lists the Master theses available related to
Duckietown. These Master's theses are to be performed at the
[Institute for Dynamic Systems and Control][idsc] under the
direction of Prof. [Emilio Frazzoli] and [Andrea Censi];
for the "interdisciplinary" theses, collaboration with other
labs is encouraged.

**Note: This page is under construction and only
a few of the Master's theses are described in detail.
Please check back by mid July to read the complete list.**

These are the Master's theses available:

1. [**Design of a worldwide low-cost robotics education experience**](#design-low-cost) -
  an interdisciplinary, entrepreneurial thesis.
2. **Optimal co-design of resource-constrained robots** - developed either as an interdisciplinary thesis in mechanical engineering/robotics, or as a theoretical thesis in applied mathematics.
3. **Vision-based SLAM under resource constraints** - a robotics robotics/vision thesis, can be developed more on the *algorithmic* side (focus on the implementation) or the _theoretical_ side (focus on models and theoretical prediction).
4. **Fleet coordination and management**
5. **Learning the rules of the road** - an algorithmic machine learning-focused thesis.
6. **Planning to learn and learning to plan**  - an algorithmic, with elements of machine learning-focused and robot planning and control
7. [**Scalable architectures for autonomy: from Duckiebot to an autonomous go-kart to a self-driving taxi**](#scalable).

## Master Thesis: Design of a worldwide low-cost robotics education experience {#design-low-cost}

Type of project: *interdisciplinary*, *entrepreneurial*.

#### Motivation

One of the goals of the Duckietown project
is to design a low-cost platform. Suppose there is 1 million
people in the world interested in learning robotics
using Duckietown. How to make it feasible for 1 million
people to have their Duckiebot?

Here, when we say "low costs", we do not include only money,
but also all the other costs that are necessary to
own and operate the platform.

Moreover, we do not consider the platform in isolation. If you are
learning robotics, probably you would also like to be learning
embedded systems, computer vision, and other similar topics
that would use similar equipment.

In this sense, while the cost of a Raspberry PI 3 is $35, that
monetary cost should be amortized among other projects that could be
performed with the same hardware.

#### Methodology

In this thesis, in addition to engineering design methods, you will be
also interacting with the customers and possible industrial partners
that are interested in manufacturing the system at a large scale.

#### Expected results

The expected results are a subset of these:

- Market research for the Duckietown customers, including:

    * Graduate and undergraduate learning institutions in high-income countries (ETHZ, MIT, ...) .
    * Graduate and undergraduate learning institutions in low-income countries.
    * K-12 institutions in high-income countries.
    * Self-guided learners in high-income countries.
    * Self-guided learners in low-income countries.

  We already have the contacts for all of these.

- Collaboration with possible industry partners that are interested
  in:
  * Manufacturing part of the system.
  * Packaging and distribution.

- Investigate link with government and NGOs to find help
  for publicizing and support the project.

## Scalable architectures for autonomy: from Duckiebot to an autonomous go-kart to a self-driving taxi {#scalable}

Robots come in all shapes and sizes. And for each one,
the software is tailor made.

But can we create a scalable architecture that works
on a wide range of platforms, such as the humble $150 Duckiebot,
a professional $10,000 go-cart, and a full-sized self-driving car?
