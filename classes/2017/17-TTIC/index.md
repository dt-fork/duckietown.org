Welcome to the webpage for the class **Self-driving Vehicles: Models and Algorithms for Autonomy** (catalogue number TTIC 31240), which is
informally known as "Duckietown".

This class is a new offering at TTIC for Autumn 2017, and follows
the [extremely successful first edition at MIT in 2016](/classes/2016/16-MIT/index.html).

[Read below about what makes this a special class](#special).


**For TTIC and UChicago Students**:
There number of spots available is extremely limited due to resource constraints (e.g., each student gets a robot). Consequently, registration is subject to instructor approval.

Please read this page thoroughly and sign up *only* if you
think the class is right for you. It might help to take a
look at the materials for the first edition of the class, at
the site [duckietown.mit.edu](http://duckietown.mit.edu).

If you'd like to register for the course, you **must** first complete this [questionnaire][questionnaire], which helps us fine-tuning the class to your background.**


## Positions available

**For TTIC and UChicago Students**: We have available positions for:

* [TAs](TAs/);
* [Other work positions](other/).

**For TTIC and UChicago postdoctoral researchers (and very senior Ph.D. students)**: Last year,
at MIT, one of the collateral uses of Duckietown was to
provide an opportunity for postdocs to
develop their teaching and mentoring skills. We will reproduce
the same idea.

We are looking for:

* [mentors](mentors/)
* [lecturers](lecturers/)

## Syllabus

(To write.)


## Grading

The grade is based on:

* the realization of a project (TBD);
* a project report (TBD); and
* a project presentation (TBD). The projects will be group-based, but the contribution of each student will be assessed individually.


## Prerequisites

* Familiarity with Linux development environment.
* Access to a laptop with Ubuntu 16.04 installed. (Note: **16**.)


## Related classes at TTIC

The most relevant course at TTIC is:

- Prof. [Walter][walter]'s [Planning, Learning, and Estimation for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence][robot-learning] (aka Robot Learning and Estimation).
If you cannot get into Self-driving Vehicles: Models and Algorithms for Autonomy, the Robot Learning and Estimation class
will give you a solid introduction to robotics.
Because the content and format are different than this course, it would be most beneficial to take Robot Learning and Estimation first, but the two can be taken in either order.

- Prof. [Scaramuzza][scaramuzza]'s [Computer Vision][scaramuzza-class] class. This class is in the first semester, and it is a great complement to this one.

# What makes this a special class {#special}


## Class philosophy

The best engineers are the ones who have solid theoretical foundations,
as well as practical experience.

In autonomous robotics, it is important to also get the "feeling" of
what actually makes a robot work. The way to do this, is not to study every component in isolation,
but rather to integrate the components as part of a complex system.

### A personal experience

Each student gets their own personal Duckiebot and can bring it home.

<!-- On the first day, you will be given a box of parts. -->


### Collaboration/competition with twin institutions

This class is offered at the same time at two others institutions:

- The University of Montreal, Canada, lead by Prof. Liam Paull.
- ETH ZÃ¼rich, lead by Dr. Andrea Censi.

The three institutions will develop the autonomous fleets together, and there will be a (very friendly) competition at the end.


<!-- ### Broader impact beyond ETH Zurich

As a student at ETH Zurich, however you arrived here,
you have been lucky.

So, a great part of this

In particular, the only ones where there is an
practical robotics part

Everything produced by the class will be open source.

### A broader, broader impact

In all of this, the whimsical aspects ...
