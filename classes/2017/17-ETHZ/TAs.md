We are looking for teaching assistants for AMOD/Duckietown.

These are the expectations for the group of AMOD/Duckietown teaching assistants as a whole:

- Help us create the robot setup instructions.
- Help us create the programming exercises.
- Help us with lecture materials.
- Provide technical assistance to the students during the class.

Note that all the materials created are going to be shared with the rest of the world --- there are many more hundreds of Duckietown students outside of ETH than there are inside! Moreover, they will eventually be published in a book (the "Duckiebook").

We are therefore looking for TAs with two types of background:

* Computational - knows programming in Python (and possibly C++), knows Linux well, has experience with ROS.
* Theoretical - likes to write lecture notes and exercises.

As a bonus, each TA gets their own Duckiebot!
