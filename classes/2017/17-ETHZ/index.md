Welcome to the webpage for the class **Autonomous Mobility on Demand (AMOD): from car to fleet**.

This class is a new offering at ETH Z&uuml;rich for Fall 2017
in the context of the [Master of Science in Robotics, Systems and Control][master] in the [Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering (D-MAVT)][mavt].

This class follows
the [extremely succesfull first edition at MIT in 2016](/classes/2016/16-MIT/index.html).

## Action items

**For ETH Z&uuml;rich Students**:
Note that there are only a limited number of spots available.
Please read this page thoroughly and sign up *only* if you think the class is right for you.
It might help to take a look at the materials for the
first edition of the class.
Please also [fill in this questionnaire][questionnaire],
which helps us fine-tuning the class to your background.

**For Z&uuml;rich postdocs**: At MIT one of the collateral
uses of Duckietown was to provide an opportunity for postdoc
to develop their teaching skills. If you are interested
in this, please contact [Andrea][censi].

## Syllabus

(To write.)


## Grading

The grade depends on:

* a project;
* a project presentation;
* a project report.

The project is in groups, but we will evaluate
the contribution of each individual in the group separately.


## Prerequisites

* Familiarity with Linux development environment.
* Access to a laptop with Ubuntu 16.04 installed. (Note: **16**.)


## Related classes at ETH Z&uuml;rich

There are several related classes available
to ETH Z&uuml;rich students.
In particular, we recommend:

- Prof. [Siegwart][siegwart]'s and Prof. [Chli][chli]'s [Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR)][AMR], in the second semester.
If you cannot get into AMOD, the AMR class
will give you a solid introduction to robotics.
Because the content and format are different than AMOD,
it makes sense to take AMR as either a follow-up to AMOD
or before AMOD.  Note also that AMR is already available
in EdX.

- Prof. [Scaramuzza][scaramuzza] [Computer Vision][scaramuzza-class] class. This class is in the first semester, and it is a great complement to this one.

# What makes this a special class {#special}

### Twin institutions

This class is offered at the same time in two others institutions:

- University of Montreal, Canada - Prof. Liam Paull
- University of Chicago / Toyota Technological Institute - Prof. Matthew Walter

We will develop the autonomous fleets together, and there will be a (friendly) competition at the end.



## Class philosophy

The best engineers are the ones who have solid foundations.

In autonomous robotics, it is important to also get the feeling of
what makes a robot work. The way to do this, is not to study every component in isolation,
but rather creating a rather complex system from scratch.

For more information
You can read this paper based on the first year edition of
Duckietown. The philosophy

### Broader impact beyond ETH Zurich

As a student at ETH Zurich, however you arrived here,
you have been lucky.

So, a great part of this

In particular, the only ones where there is an
practical robotics part

Everything produced by the class will be open source.

### A broader, broader impact

In all of this, the whimsical aspects ...



## Class format

On the first day, you will be given a box of parts.
