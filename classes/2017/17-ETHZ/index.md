Welcome to the webpage for the class **Autonomous Mobility on Demand (AMOD): from car to fleet**.

This class is a new offering at ETH Z&uuml;rich for Fall 2017
in the context of the [Master of Science in Robotics, Systems and Control][master] in the [Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering (D-MAVT)][mavt].

This class follows
the [extremely succesfull first edition at MIT in 2016](/classes/2016/16-MIT/index.html).

## Action items

**For ETH Z&uuml;rich Students**:
Note that there is only a limited number of spots available.
Please read this page thoroughly and sign up *only* if you think the class is right for you.
It might help to take a look at the materials for the
first edition of the class, at the site [duckietown.mit.edu](http://duckietown.mit.edu).
Even though the material will be different, we will have the same style.

<!--
Jacopo: this is the time if you want to do it.

Please also [fill in this questionnaire][questionnaire],
which helps us fine-tuning the class to your background. -->

**For ETH Z&uuml;rich postdocs and researchers**: At MIT one of the collateral
uses of Duckietown was to provide an opportunity for postdoc
to develop their teaching skills. If you are interested
in this, please contact [Andrea Censi][censi].

## Syllabus

(To write.)


## Grading

The grade depends on:

* a project;
* a project presentation;
* a project report.

The project is in groups, but we will evaluate
the contribution of each individual in the group separately.


## Prerequisites

* Familiarity with Linux development environment.
* Access to a laptop with Ubuntu 16.04 installed. (Note: **16**.)


## Related classes at ETH Z&uuml;rich

There are several related classes available
to ETH Z&uuml;rich students.
In particular, we recommend:

- Prof. [Siegwart][siegwart]'s and Prof. [Chli][chli]'s [Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR)][AMR], in the second semester.
If you cannot get into AMOD, the AMR class
will give you a solid introduction to robotics.
Because the content and format are different than AMOD,
it makes sense to take AMR as either a follow-up to AMOD
or before AMOD.  Note also that AMR is already available
in EdX.

- Prof. [Scaramuzza][scaramuzza] [Computer Vision][scaramuzza-class] class. This class is in the first semester, and it is a great complement to this one.

# What makes this a special class {#special}

### Collaboration/competition with twin institutions

This class is offered at the same time at two others institutions:

- At the University of Montreal, Canada, lead by Prof. Liam Paull.
- At the University of Chicago / Toyota Technological Institute, led by Prof. Matthew Walter.

The three institutions will develop the autonomous fleets together, and there will be
a (very friendly) competition at the end.


## Class philosophy

The best engineers are the ones who have solid theoretical foundations,
as well as practical experience.

In autonomous robotics, it is important to also get the "feeling" of
what actually makes a robot work. The way to do this, is not to study every component in isolation,
but rather creating a complex system.

<!-- ### Broader impact beyond ETH Zurich

As a student at ETH Zurich, however you arrived here,
you have been lucky.

So, a great part of this

In particular, the only ones where there is an
practical robotics part

Everything produced by the class will be open source.

### A broader, broader impact

In all of this, the whimsical aspects ...
