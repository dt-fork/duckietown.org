The Duckietown project is still in its infancy, and we have
a long way to go; we are happy to get all the help
we can get.


### Individuals

In particular, we are looking for volunteers who
could be:

- **community managers**, who can handle our Facebook page, mailing lists, Vimeo/Youtube, and similar ways to communicate;
- **web developers**, to make this and other pages prettier;
- **software developers** and **testers**;
- **translators** for translating the documentation
  to other languages;
- **legal counsel**, to help us drafting collaboration contracts with companies.

If you would like to help in any of this, please [contact us](contact).

### Partners

We are looking for partner companies who would like to
help us make Duckietown into a product that is broadly
distributed.

Please [get in touch with us](contact) if you are interested.


### Sponsors

We are looking for sponsors. Please [get in touch with us](contact).
