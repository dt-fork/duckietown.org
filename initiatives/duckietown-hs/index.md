    <p> DuckietownHS is inspired by the Duckietown project and targeted for high schools. <img src='dthslogo.jpg' style="width:250px;height:196px;" align="right"/>
  The goal is to build and program duckiebots capable of moving autonomously on the streets of Duckietown. 
  Unlike the Duckietown project, duckiebotHS does not use a camera as a sensor, but perception is based on infrared sensors to stay in     the lane, gyroscope and accelerometers to help determine the vehicle's progress and proximity sensors based on technology "Time of       Flight" for avoiding obstacles.  
  The crossings are operated by traffic lights arranged horizontally on the road. The color is read through a color sensor located on the     bottom of the chassis. 
  The basic mission is to make the vehicle self-driving and respectful of road signs. In addition to the traffic lights there are road signs that provide information about the intersection. The road sign encodes this information that is read through the infrared sensors.
  Vehicle control is carried out by a <a href="http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/mcu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-nucleo/nucleo-f401re.html">NUCLEO-F401RE</a> board that uses a microcontroller ARM®32-bit Cortex®-M4 CPU with FPU.
The DuckiebotHS has on board a Low voltage dual brush DC motor driver expansion board, the <a href="http://www.st.com/en/ecosystems/x-nucleo-ihm12a1.html">X-NUCLEO-IHM12A1</a>, a Motion MEMS and environmental sensor expansion board, the <a href="http://www.st.com/en/ecosystems/x-nucleo-iks01a2.html">X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2</a>, and a Ranging sensor expansion board, the <a href="http://www.st.com/en/ecosystems/x-nucleo-53l0a1.html">X-NUCLEO-53L0A1</a>. 
  The project is promoted by the non-profit organization <a href="http://www.perlatecnica.it">Perlatecnica</a> based in Italy. Currently, ten Italian high schools are involved in developing their duckiebots.
